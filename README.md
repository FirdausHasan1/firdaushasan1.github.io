## Video Demo

### Description:

A Webpage that accept a SQL command to query a database file. I'm using the fiftyville pset and turned it into a webpage mystery game (detective solving quest game). By using the sql.js which is a JavaScript SQL database.  It allows me to create a relational database and query it entirely in the browser. I've preloaded the fiftyville.db file, in result it can query entirely in the browser. It uses a virtual database file stored in memory, and thus doesn't persist the changes made to the database. The input area can accept multiple command and display multiple table on its own by separating it with a semicolon. I've also created a check.js file to check the answer whether the input use, is the right one or not and give out a response back using a memegen. The memegen will response accordingly with the user input.

## How the webpage works?

Its simple. Just insert the SQL Command and click Run. It will query through the preloaded db file and create a table of database without refreshing the page

## Development Environment:

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Gui

### Database

- A preloaded database has been set. Which is the fiftyville database file.

## Possible improvements

As all webpage this one can also be improved. Possible improvements:

- Create another webpage that use a different database file for a new sql mystery game
- By combining a cypher code and this sql database webpage. We can create a lot more interactive mystery game.

## Limitation

- Time limitation. Due to time limitation I can only create a simple webpage like this. With more time i can create a better with more interactive cypher databse mystery game
