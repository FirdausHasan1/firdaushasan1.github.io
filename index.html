      <h3>What is SQL?</h3> <!-- taken from w3school this explanation-->
      <h4>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It lets you access and manipulate databases
        and  became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986,
        and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
